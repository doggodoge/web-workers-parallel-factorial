# Web Worker Parallel Factorial

I am once again messing about with concurrency and parallel programming, but
this time with the Web!

A little more complicated than I'd like. Might be better to use something like
the `threads.js` library that implements a thread pool. Something to try out
next time, this only really uses one runtime library. Lodash. I should
reimplement the chunk function to remove this dependency.

## Instructions

Kick off a development server with hot-loading.

```shell
$ yarn start
```

Build a production build.

```shell
$ yarn build
```
